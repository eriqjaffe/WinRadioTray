# WinRadioTray
A simple internet radio player that sits in the System Tray, hence the name.  It is heavily influenced by a Linux application called [Radio Tray](https://github.com/lubosz/radiotray), written by Carlos Ribiero.

This software makes use of the following:
- [BASS Audio Library](http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html) for audio playback and metadata retrieval.
- [LowKey](https://github.com/Beluki/LowKey) by Beluki.
- Parts of the GUI are taken from [GaGa](https://github.com/Beluki/GaGa), also by Beluki.
- Icons are from [icons8](https://icons8.com/).

To the best of my knowledge, the above sources are all free software without any licensing restrictions when used for non-commercial application.
                
Built against Dot Net 4.5, so if you're running a recent-ish build of Windows you should already be OK there.
