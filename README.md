# WinRadioTray
A small internet radio player that lives in your notification area.  Heavily inspired by [Radio Tray](https://github.com/lubosz/radiotray).

Built against Dot Net 4.5, so if you're running a recent-ish build of Windows you should already be OK there.

Icons from [icons8](https://icons8.com/).
